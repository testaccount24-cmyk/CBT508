Hello Sam

I found out how to preserve the ISPF environment.  In the TSO/E
Programming Services Manual ch. 23, it explains how the isolated
and unisolated flags work.  By setting the flag to x'01' an
UN-Isolated environment is built and then the current services
are available.  If set to x'00' an Isolated environment is created
and no current services are available.  Attached is a sample
program EXCMD01.  Give it a try.
