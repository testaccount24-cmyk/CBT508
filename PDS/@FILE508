//***FILE 508 is from A.L. Richards and contains 2 commands         *   FILE 508
//*           written in Assembler, to call a CLIST or REXX exec    *   FILE 508
//*           under TSO.  The reason these commands were written,   *   FILE 508
//*           was to execute CLISTs or REXX execs related to LOGON  *   FILE 508
//*           processing, when a program is the only thing that     *   FILE 508
//*           can be used for the purpose.                          *   FILE 508
//*                                                                 *   FILE 508

//*           EXCMD     -  Program which invokes a TSO command      *   FILE 508
//*                        and destroys the ISPF environment,       *   FILE 508
//*                        so if you are under ISPF and can't       *   FILE 508
//*                        get out of it, and you need to execute   *   FILE 508
//*                        a program which can't run under ISPF,    *   FILE 508
//*                        this is the tool to use.                 *   FILE 508

//*           EXCMDI    -  Program which invokes a TSO command      *   FILE 508
//*                        and preserves the ISPF environment.      *   FILE 508

//*                        the two source programs to see the       *   FILE 508
