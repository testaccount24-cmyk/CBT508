Subject:        RE: clist/command processor


I found an example of the command processor calling a clist in an
old Rockwell program written by R.A.SUNDELL. I have made a sample
version of it.  It will invoke whatever is passed in the parm
field. I.E.  EXCMD %clistxx,  or EXCMD clistxx. The documentation
can be found in the TSO/E programming services manual. The utility
is the TSO/E Service Facility Routine 'IKJEFTSR'.

  Note from Sam Golob:  This command as written, appears to destroy
   the ISPF environment, so it may be useful to invoke, in a situation
   where you can't easily get out of ISPF, and you want to run a clist
   or TSO command that needs to run without ISPF.

  Example:   TSO EXCMD cmdname    (where cmdname does not "like" ISPF)

Original Question:

Sam

I am looking for a sample of how to invoke an REXX or Clist from
a TSO command processor written in Assembler. I have searched
through the cbt index and downloaded a few of the files.  I have
not found what I am looking for.

Thanks
